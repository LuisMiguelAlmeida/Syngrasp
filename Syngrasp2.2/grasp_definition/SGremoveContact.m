%    SGremoveContact - Remove a contact point on the hand
%
%    The function allows to remove a contact point on the hand given as
%    argument
%
%    Usage: hand = SGaddContact(hand,finger,link,alpha)
%
%    Arguments:
%    hand = the hand structure on which the contact points lie
%    finger = the finger on which the contact point lies
%    link = the link where the contact point lies
%    alpha = an argument that parameterize the position of the contact
%       point on the link (0 = link base; 1 = link end)
%
%    Returns:
%    newHand = the hand without the specified contact point
%
